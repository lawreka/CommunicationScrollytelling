          Microsoft's first conversational agent was Rover, a dog who sat in the corner of the screen of the Microsoft Bob interface, part of the 'Microsoft Home' software line. The Microsoft Bob interface was inspired by Packard Bell Navigator and was set up as an image of a cozy office.

            Clippy is able to help guide the user through using Microsoft Office in two ways: Natural Language Queries and the Proactive Help System. A Natural Language Query is when you type a question into his help box. He will provide the same answers as the Answer Wizard.

          <div id="proactive" class="text">
            The Proactive Help System is what he was famous for: the program guesses from the user's actions if they are struggling to complete a task and a lightbulb appears over Clippy's head before he offers help. The letter-writing tip became Clippy's signature.

When Bob crashed, we took the character help over to Word. We designed about 250 characters, and I had about 15 or 20 of 'em in there. Through working with some social psychologists out of Stanford, we spent six months going through them all, whittling them down with focus groups and stuff like that, and [Clippy] came out to be the number one most trustful and engaging and endearing character of them all.

            </div>
            <div id="kindchen" class="text">
              One of Clippy's major design flaws is a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness" target="_blank">Kindchenschema</a>, a psychological effect produced by characters that have baby-like features like big eyes and small bodies. An effective use of Kindchenschema causes one to care for an animated character; while Clippy does have large eyes, they are one of the only features ( with no big cute head for them to be compared with) and his eyebrows, being the only other expressive feature and proportional to his eyes, signal both masculinity and maturity.

              The four characteristics that "strongly cue the idea that one is interacting with a social actor" are language use, interactivity, playing a social role, and using human-sounding speech (or text). It is Clippy's interaction and social skills that allow us to view him as a social actor, but his lack of social graces (interrupting, interjecting, and popping up when one is trying to work) make him a very rude one. Without any turn-taking actions or ability to predict whether the user actually needs help, his over-eagerness to help actually makes him a distraction. In Luke Swartz's analysis <a href="http://xenon.stanford.edu/~lswartz/paperclip/" target="_blank">"Why People Hate The Paperclip,"</a> he has deduced that cognitive labelling is very important to our perception of agents. Whether they are introduced as entertaining or helpful will change how much we enjoy their contributions during work, and if the label does not match the behavior (as in Clippy's case, labeled as helpful but acting as distracting), we don't like it.
