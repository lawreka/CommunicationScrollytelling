There are several theories about the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1576250?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">phenomenology of human-computer interaction</a> that have attempted to figure out why.

          Characters like Clippy and the other conversational agents included in Microsoft Office 1997 exploit this subconscious phenomenon by making it an explicit part of the software design... but Clippy did it so, so wrong.

            Clippy is able to help guide the user through using Microsoft Office in two ways: Natural Language Queries and the Proactive Help System. A Natural Language Query is when you type a question into his help box. He will provide the same answers as the Answer Wizard.
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            The Proactive Help System is what he was famous for: the program guesses from the user's actions if they are struggling to complete a task and a lightbulb appears over Clippy's head before he offers help. The letter-writing tip became Clippy's signature.

          </div>
          <div class="text">
            When not offering help, Clippy's idle animations include blinking, sleeping, or "helping" with various tasks (even though the agent actually has nothing to do with them) like saving the document.
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            There was a "joke" circulated at Microsoft uncovered by James Fallows' <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2008/04/-quot-clippy-quot-update-now-with-organizational-anthropology/8006/" target="_blank">investigation about the development and eventual decommissioning of Clippy</a>, which he describes as organizational anthropology but is at best a misogynist rumor:
            <span class="quote">"For a while the head of the Bob project was one Melinda French, who by the time I was on campus had become Melinda French Gates, first lady of the corporation...I don't want to overstate this -- the fact that Clippy had been the brainchild of the boss's wife was mentioned as a little joke, not a seriously decisive factor. But it was a joke everybody knew."</span>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            All other histories of Clippy's design process point to a lack of women involved in the design process as one of its major failures. In the documentary <a href="https://www.codedoc.co/" target="_blank">Code: Debugging the gender gap</a>, former Microsoft executive Roz Ho is quoted saying she was in the room during the design process and that early focus groups hated Clippy: <span class="quote">"We did a bunch of focus-group testing, and the results came back kind of negative. Most of the women thought the characters were too male and that they were leering at them. So we're sitting in a conference room. There's me and I think, like, eleven or twelve guys, and we're going through the results, and they said, 'I don't see it. I just don't know what they’re talking about.' And I said, 'Guys, guys, look, I'm a woman, and I'm going to tell you, these animated characters are male-looking.' "</span>

            In <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyj55a/microsoft-clippy-creator-interview-kevin-atteberry" target="_blank">an interview with Motherboard</a>, he described the design process and confirmed that the characters were descended from Microsoft Bob, but he has a very different perspective on the focus groups' opinions: <span class="quote">"I originally worked on a project called Microsoft Bob, which was probably their biggest failure ever. When Bob crashed, we took the character help over to Word. We designed about 250 characters, and I had about 15 or 20 of 'em in there. Through working with some social psychologists out of Stanford, we spent six months going through them all, whittling them down with focus groups and stuff like that, and [Clippy] came out to be the number one most trustful and engaging and endearing character of them all. So he became the default."</span> The commonly held belief now is that Clippy was chosen as the default because his character was the only office supply.

              TIME magazine deemed Clippy one of the <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1991915_1991909_1991755,00.html" target="_blank">50 Worst Inventions</a> of all time. But the question remains, why did people find his attempts at being helpful so annoying?
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              One of Clippy's major design flaws is a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness" target="_blank">Kindchenschema</a>, a psychological effect produced by characters that have baby-like features like big eyes and small bodies. An effective use of Kindchenschema causes one to care for an animated character; while Clippy does have large eyes, they are one of the only features ( with no big cute head for them to be compared with) and his eyebrows, being the only other expressive feature and proportional to his eyes, signal both masculinity and maturity.

              The four characteristics that "strongly cue the idea that one is interacting with a social actor" are language use, interactivity, playing a social role, and using human-sounding speech (or text). It is Clippy's interaction and social skills that allow us to view him as a social actor, but his lack of social graces (interrupting, interjecting, and popping up when one is trying to work) make him a very rude one. Without any turn-taking actions or ability to predict whether the user actually needs help, his over-eagerness to help actually makes him a distraction. In Luke Swartz's analysis <a href="http://xenon.stanford.edu/~lswartz/paperclip/" target="_blank">"Why People Hate The Paperclip,"</a> he has deduced that cognitive labelling is very important to our perception of agents. Whether they are introduced as entertaining or helpful will change how much we enjoy their contributions during work, and if the label does not match the behavior (as in Clippy's case, labeled as helpful but acting as distracting), we don't like it.

In a 2016 Microsoft conference, Julie Larson-Green, Microsoft Office's chief experience officer and a 23-year company executive, took responsibility for killing Clippy. <span class="quote">"I'm the one who took Clippy out of Office,"</a> Larson-Green confessed to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.de/microsoft-julie-larson-green-on-clippy-and-cortana-2016-3?r=US&IR=T" target="_blank">Business Insider</a>.
